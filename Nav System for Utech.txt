Nav System for Utech

Inputs
-File = Nodes (Intersections and Building Entrances), Edges (Physical Roads), Weight (Distance of each edge in unit: int km), and direction (Direction of traffic on the road)
-User = Source Node and Destination Node
-Building-Node Dictionary (Associate each Building with a Node)

Processes
-Find path using Breadth First Search algorithm

Outputs
-Traverse the sequence while highlighting or changing the color of each edge

Data Structure: Array of Linked List (Adjacency List)
Where each header of the linked list is a different node and next pointer points to the a nodes that the header is adjacent with.



Solution Design:

1. Know how much nodes and edges we will need.
2. Create a adjacent matrix or list
3. Perform BFS with source and destination nodes
4. Plot the graph on the Utech map using JavaScript
